# evernote-client

### Cross-platform client for Evernote

## Run

Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the renderer process in [**hot-module-replacement**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) mode and starts a server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

You Run these two commands __simultaneously__ in different console tabs:

```bash
$ npm run start-renderer-dev
$ npm run start-main-dev
```
